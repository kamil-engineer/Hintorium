Hintorium is a modern, highly configurable tooltip library built with TypeScript.
It provides developers with an easy way to add interactive, accessible, and responsive tooltips to any web project.

## 🚀 Overview

Hintorium goes beyond standard tooltips by offering:

- Smart positioning with automatic flipping to stay within viewport
- Multiple themes: dark, light, glass, pastel, neon, gradient
- Smooth animations: fade, slide, zoom, bounce
- HTML and dynamic content support (callbacks, async loading, remote content)
- Accessibility (keyboard focus support, ARIA attributes)
- Mobile-friendly interaction (tap & long-press)
- Configurable delay, size, and custom rendering options
- Extensible plugin system (Markdown, i18n, analytics, inline hints, onboarding)

---

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible positioning

Tooltips can appear on top, bottom, left, or right of any element.
If there isn’t enough space, Hintorium intelligently flips the tooltip to fit.

### 2. Rich content support

Supports plain text, safe HTML, DOM elements, or dynamically loaded content from APIs or callbacks.
Includes loading and error states with accessible visual feedback.

### 3. Multiple themes & animations

Choose from a variety of visual styles and entry/exit animations to match your UI.

### 4. Accessibility (A11y)

Built with ARIA and keyboard navigation in mind. Tooltips are fully screen-reader compatible.

### 5. Mobile & responsive

Tooltips automatically adjust to viewport size and handle touch interactions seamlessly.

### 6. Extensible

Hintorium is designed to grow with your project:

- Markdown rendering
- Internationalization (i18n)
- Inline hints with icons
- Guided onboarding / tooltips tours
- Analytics tracking tooltip usage
